  <h2>Embarkation Day</h2>
 <p>We arrived at the terminal an hour early, just before noon, after a smooth and straightforward journey. Mark had gathered us all and driven us down to Southampton with ease.</p>

<p>Check-in was seamless, and before long, we were aboard <em>Iona</em>, settling into the buffet and savoring a well-earned lunch. The afternoon unfolded at a relaxed pace, giving us time to explore before heading to our cabins, where our luggage was already waiting. We met our cabin steward Sang and unpacked. With everything in place, we settled in comfortably.</p>

<p>As the clock struck 6:30 pm, sailaway began, marking the official start of our adventure. Later, at 7:00 pm, we reunited with Joanne and Luke at The Emerald Bar for a pre-dinner cocktail, indulging in the vibrant atmosphere.</p>

<p>Our evening culminated in a delightful dinner at Aqua Restaurant—a perfect way to wrap up our first day aboard.</p>
