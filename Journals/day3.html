  <h2>Stavanger Stopover</h2>

<p>We arrived at our first port of call, the charming town of Stavanger, bathed in bright, dry weather with a comfortable temperature of 20¬∞C. While many passengers disembarked to explore the town, we enjoyed the relative quiet on board. It was the perfect opportunity to catch up on reading and tackle the daily sudoku and crossword, a welcome change of pace.</p>

<p>Later in the day, we ventured ashore for a relaxed stroll to the Cardinal Pub‚Äîwell-known for its impressive collection of nearly 600 types of beer. We each sampled a different brew: a rich Dark Brown Ale, a refreshing citrusy IPA, and a locally crafted lager. The welcoming atmosphere and friendly service made for a pleasant hour before we returned to <em>Iona</em>, just in time for sailaway at 4:30 PM.</p>
