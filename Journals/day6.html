  <h2>Day Six – Haugesund Adventure</h2>

<p>Our visit to Haugesund started with a change in schedule. The captain advised that due to very windy weather expected later in the day, our departure time would be brought forward to 2:30 PM. Despite this, we managed to make the most of our time ashore.</p>

<p>Joanne, Luke, and I embarked on a thrilling RIB Safari, operated by Viking Adventures. The ride was exhilarating, with plenty of bumpy jumps in the waves as we zipped across the sea. The highlight was visiting the fascinating offshore villages, where we learned about the local way of life and the history of the region.</p>

<p>After returning to Iona, we relaxed with cocktails in the Emerald Bar, enjoying the familiar atmosphere. Dinner followed at Aqua Restaurant, where we savoured the delicious cuisine as always. To round off the evening, we headed to the 710 Club, where the resident band provided a lively soundtrack to end our day in style.</p>
