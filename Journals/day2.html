  <h2>Sunday, 11th May – First Day at Sea</h2>

<p>Our first full day at sea began with a delicious breakfast at Aqua Restaurant, setting a relaxed tone for the day ahead.</p>

<p>While Joanne and Luke explored the ship, we found a quiet and comfortable spot on the upper level of the SkyDome. The weather remained bright and dry, creating a serene atmosphere as the ship sailed steadily north into the vast expanse of the North Sea. At one point, Joanne and I enjoyed a tranquil session in the Infinity hot tub—a peaceful retreat with sweeping ocean views.</p>

<p>As evening approached, we gathered in The Crow’s Nest bar for cocktails, dressed for Celebration Night. The lively, elegant atmosphere made for a perfect prelude to dinner at the Epicurean Restaurant, where we enjoyed a superb meal to round off the day in style.</p>

  <strong>Travel Tip:</strong> On Celebration Night, the ship’s dress code usually calls for formal or semi-formal attire, offering a great excuse to dress up and capture some memorable photos.
