  <h2>Sunday, 11th May ‚Äì First Day at Sea</h2>

<p>Our first full day at sea began with a delicious breakfast at Aqua Restaurant, setting a relaxed tone for the day ahead.</p>

<p>While Joanne and Luke explored the ship, we found a quiet and comfortable spot on the upper level of the SkyDome. The weather remained bright and dry, creating a serene atmosphere as the ship sailed steadily north into the vast expanse of the North Sea. At one point, Joanne and I enjoyed a tranquil session in the Infinity hot tub‚Äîa peaceful retreat with sweeping ocean views.</p>

<p>As evening approached, we gathered in The Crow‚Äôs Nest bar for cocktails, dressed for Celebration Night. The lively, elegant atmosphere made for a perfect prelude to dinner at the Epicurean Restaurant, where we enjoyed a superb meal to round off the day in style.</p>
