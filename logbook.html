    <h2>Day 1 – Departure from Southampton</h2>
    <p>Mark arrived at 10:00 am to pick up Gill and me, then we headed off to collect Joanne and Luke. From there, we drove to Ocean Terminal in Southampton. After dropping off our cases at the gate, we checked in and boarded the Iona.</p>
    <p>Once on board, we reported to our muster station, then made our way to the Horizon buffet for lunch. The afternoon was spent exploring the ship and getting our bearings before the sailaway at 5:30 pm.</p>
    <p>Back at our cabins, we found our luggage had arrived. We unpacked, freshened up, and changed for our first evening onboard. Later, we met Joanne and Luke at the Emerald Bar for a pre-dinner cocktail. After a lovely dinner, we rounded off the evening with some time in the Clubhouse before retiring to our cabins for a well-earned sleep.</p>
