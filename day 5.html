  <h2>Exploring the Fjords</h2>
  <p>We woke to the peaceful surroundings of Olden, nestled at the end of a narrow fjord surrounded by dramatic peaks. The early morning light cast a gentle glow over the still waters, setting the scene for an exciting day ahead.</p>

  <p>After breakfast at Aqua, Joanne, Luke, and I joined an excursion to the Loen Sky Lift. This remarkable cable car took us soaring from the fjord to the top of Mount Hoven in just a few minutes, offering breathtaking panoramic views of the fjord and surrounding mountains. It was a highlight of the trip, and the sheer scale of the landscape was truly awe-inspiring.</p>

  <p>Later in the afternoon, Iona sailed through Innvikfjorden, one of Norway’s lesser-known yet equally stunning waterways. From the SkyDome, we enjoyed sweeping views of towering mountains and lush hillsides as the ship glided silently through the still waters.</p>

  <p>The sailaway from Olden turned into quite a spectacle. Locals lined the quayside waving both Union Flags and Norwegian flags, while a lively playlist of well-known songs—including Rod Stewart’s <em>Sailing</em>—filled the air. On the starboard side of the ship, passengers waved enthusiastically from their balconies and the promenade decks, creating a festive farewell atmosphere as we sailed away.</p>

  <p>As evening approached, we enjoyed cocktails in the familiar surroundings of the Emerald Bar before heading to Aqua Restaurant for dinner. It was a perfect end to a day of natural wonders and friendly farewells.</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <strong>Travel Tip:</strong> The Loen Sky Lift is one of the steepest cable cars in the world, rising 1,011 metres in just five minutes. At the top, there are scenic viewpoints, hiking trails, and a mountaintop restaurant for those looking to linger.
