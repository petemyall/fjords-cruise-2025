  <h2>Exploring the Fjords</h2>
  <p>We woke to the peaceful surroundings of Olden, nestled at the end of a narrow fjord surrounded by dramatic peaks. The early morning light cast a gentle glow over the still waters, setting the scene for an exciting day ahead.</p>

  <p>After breakfast at Aqua, Joanne, Luke, and I joined an excursion to the Loen Sky Lift. This remarkable cable car took us soaring from the fjord to the top of Mount Hoven in just a few minutes, offering breathtaking panoramic views of the fjord and surrounding mountains. It was a highlight of the trip, and the sheer scale of the landscape was truly awe-inspiring.</p>

  <p>Later in the afternoon, Iona sailed through Innvikfjorden, one of Norway‚Äôs lesser-known yet equally stunning waterways. From the SkyDome, we enjoyed sweeping views of towering mountains and lush hillsides as the ship glided silently through the still waters.</p>

  <p>The sailaway from Olden turned into quite a spectacle. Locals lined the quayside waving both Union Flags and Norwegian flags, while a lively playlist of well-known songs‚Äîincluding Rod Stewart‚Äôs <em>Sailing</em>‚Äîfilled the air. On the starboard side of the ship, passengers waved enthusiastically from their balconies and the promenade decks, creating a festive farewell atmosphere as we sailed away.</p>

  <p>As evening approached, we enjoyed cocktails in the familiar surroundings of the Emerald Bar before heading to Aqua Restaurant for dinner. It was a perfect end to a day of natural wonders and friendly farewells.</p>
